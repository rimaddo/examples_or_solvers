# Examples OR Solvers

An overview of the free OR solvers out there, with a sad resignation to a lack of gurobi access.

## Assement Criteria

- easy to install (don’t want to give up compiling c++ dependencies for days before I’ve even started)
- speedy to solve
- fast to iterate with (prefer object-oriented over indexed / matrix based)
- easy to debug, e.g. clear statuses, errors, iis as gold standard
- some options to get under the hood a little e.g. callbacks
- bonus points if it’s open source and I can contribute to it
